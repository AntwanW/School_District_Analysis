# School District Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

This analysis aims to replace the inaccurate data for reading and math scores at Thomas High School for the 9th graders while keeping the rest of the data intact. It will analyze the data by focusing on the various metrics that measure the school's total budget, average math and reading scores, and overall passing percentage.


## Results:

The analysis kept the rest of the data intact. The only data that was affected was 9th graders reading and math scores at Thomas High School. The district and school are affected only in the 9th grade. It affects Thomas High School's performance because they cannot compete with the other schools for the academic dishonesty in the 9th grade. The scores are affected only in the 9th grade, but school spending, size, and type are not affected.

## Summary:

The number of students at Thomas High School has decreased, as has the average math and reading scores due to the 9th grade. The number of students who were counted has also reduced. The decrease in the number of students has led to a change in the average scores and percentage changes. Due to the small changes in the scores and percentage changes, it is unlikely that the removal of 9th-grade reading and math scores will significantly impact the school.
